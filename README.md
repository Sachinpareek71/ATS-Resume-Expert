# ATS-Resume-Expert




Developed an innovative Resume Evaluation Tool using Google's generative model (Gemini) to simulate an advanced Application Tracking System (ATS). The tool assesses resumes against given job descriptions, providing valuable insights for optimizing resumes in the competitive job market.

# Key Contributions:

Integrated Google's generative model (Gemini) for accurate resume analysis.
Implemented a user-friendly interface using Streamlit for seamless user experience.
Enabled users to upload resumes (PDF format) and input job descriptions for evaluation.
Automated the extraction of text from PDF resumes using PyPDF2 library.
Designed and implemented a structured prompt template for the generative model.


# Features:

Percentage matching based on the job description for comprehensive assessment.
Identification of missing keywords to enhance resume content.
Generation of a profile summary for a quick overview.


# Outcome:


The tool provides users with detailed feedback, including percentage matching, missing keywords, and a profile summary. Users can experiment with different job descriptions to optimize their resumes effectively.

# Technologies Used:

Python (Streamlit, PyPDF2)
Google's Generative Model (Gemini)
API integration for model configuration


# Results:


The tool demonstrates high accuracy in evaluating resumes, helping users understand their competitiveness in the job market and providing actionable suggestions for improvement.

This project showcases my proficiency in Python, API integration, and the ability to develop practical solutions for real-world challenges in the job application process.
